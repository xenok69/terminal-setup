## Dependencies

Here are a few dependencies I like to use for my Terminal

| dependency | setup cmd |
| ---------- | --------- |
| oh-my-posh | `winget install --id=JanDeDobbeleer.OhMyPosh -e` |
| chafa | `winget install --id=hpjansson.Chafa -e` |
| fastfetch | `winget install --id=Fastfetch-cli.Fastfetch -e` |

Packages are not everything; you also need to download and install [FiraCode Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.4.0/FiraCode.zip).

This is an awesome Font that I like to use personally for most my coding IDEs. This is personal preference, so you can also use a different font if you'd like.

## Theme Setup

Once you have entered your Terminal; there should be different tabs at the very top.
Click the little arrow point down next to the plus and click on settings. ( Or press `Ctrl + ,` on your keyboard )

Click on the very bottom left where it says: `Open JSON file` and paste the content from `TerminalSettings.json` ( in the bin folder in this repository ) into that file.

Once you have that, your Terminal should have the preloaded color theme, transparency and acrylic theme installed.
